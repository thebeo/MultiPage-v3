LaTeX code to edit a visual music score dedicated to handpan and non-musicians:
5 main ways to represent music:
* Phrase: visual representation of a handpan from the top with the note to play and arrows between notes/ use for known melody as rhythm is not visualized
* Chord: series of Chords (up to 3 notes but often only two notes)/ used for Harmony pieces
* Master: movement with alternation of right and left hand, one note per beat, and ghost note for silence. Used when the rhythm is essential
* Notes: just a list of note names to play
* Symbol: a list of symbols - a symbol is a mnemotechnic representation of a small piece of music.

The different ways can be mixed in a score.

Some notations are used to format the score:
* ||| new page ( with D=16 colomns H = 8 colomns) and a page title
* || new line with T and a background color for the line and 4 (or 2) possible titles
* | a content (O or o for a Phrase, C or c for a Chord, M or m for a master, N or n for Note, P or p for Note in block, and S or s for Symbol

The LaTeX code reads a .txt file and produces a pdf: MusicaProManupan.pdf
